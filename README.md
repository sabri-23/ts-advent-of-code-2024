# Advent of Code with RxJS and TypeScript

Welcome to my Advent of Code (AoC) challenge repository! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ„

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. These puzzles can be solved in any programming language.

## My Advent of Code Setup

### Tools of the Trade
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- **Framework**: [Nx](https://nx.dev)
- **Paradigm**: Everything is a stream! Using [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) as much as possible to make this a functional, reactive adventure.

### Running Each Dayâ€™s Solution
Each dayâ€™s puzzle lives as its own module in this Nx repository. To run a specific dayâ€™s solution, use the following command:

```bash
npm run day-<day_number>
```
Example for Day 1:
```bash
npm run day-01
```

### The Challenge
**Goal**: Solve puzzles reactively, embrace functional programming, and have fun!

## Why RxJS?

RxJS makes problem-solving a thrilling ride by turning every input into a stream and letting you compose solutions in imaginative ways. 

Each puzzle becomes an opportunity to flex reactive musclesâ€”filtering, mapping, merging, and zipping data streams together like a coding wizard. It's not just about solving puzzles; it's about doing it with style!

## Repo Structure
Each dayâ€™s solution is a separate module within the Nx repository. Hereâ€™s a high-level structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ day-01
â”œâ”€â”€ day-02
â”œâ”€â”€ day-03
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Final Words ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰

As you embark on this reactive coding journey, remember:

- When in doubt, map it out.
- FlatMap your frustrations.
- Catch errors, but donâ€™t let them debounce your spirit.


Happy coding, and may your observables always emit joy and success! ðŸš€
